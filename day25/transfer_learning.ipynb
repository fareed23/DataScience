    "### What is transfer learning and how it works?\n",
    "Transfer learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on learning from one task and applying it to another task. This is done by reusing parts of a neural network that have been trained for a similar task, thus reducing the amount of data and computational resources required for training the network."
